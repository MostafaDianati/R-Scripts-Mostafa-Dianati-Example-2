#For my previous project this is a sample to simulates data on:
#age, sex, vitamin D, red meat consumption, fish consumption, olive oil consumption, family history of cancer and bladder cancer risk. Then I performed logistic regression to see the association between these factors and bladder cancer risk. Additionally, it conducts t-test, ANOVA, and chi-square test to analyze the significance of individual factors on bladder cancer risk.
#Import my original date: 
write.table(DataToExport, file="bladdercacner.csv", sep=",")
# Or make a data simulation as bellow: 

# First, I need to install tidyverse package
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load the above libraries
library(tidyverse)
# and 
library(MASS)

# # Just as a simulation data:

sample_size <- 750
patients <- data.frame(
  group = rep('patient', sample_size),
  age = rnorm(sample_size, mean=60, sd=10),
  sex = factor(sample(rbind('male', 'female'), sample_size, replace=TRUE)),
  vitamin_D = rnorm(sample_size, mean=30, sd=5),
  red_meat_consumption = rnorm(sample_size, mean=5, sd=1.5),
  fish_consumption = rnorm(sample_size, mean=3, sd=1),
  olive_oil_consumption = rnorm(sample_size, mean=2, sd=0.5),
  family_history = factor(sample(rbind('yes', 'no'), sample_size, replace=TRUE)),
  stage = factor(sample(1:4, sample_size, replace=TRUE), ordered=TRUE),
  mortality = rbinom(sample_size, 1, prob=0.05)
)

controls <- data.frame(
  group = rep('control', sample_size),
  age = rnorm(sample_size, mean=60, sd=10),
  sex = factor(sample(rbind('male', 'female'), sample_size, replace=TRUE)),
  vitamin_D = rnorm(sample_size, mean=30, sd=5),
  red_meat_consumption = rnorm(sample_size, mean=5, sd=1.5),
  fish_consumption = rnorm(sample_size, mean=3, sd=1),
  olive_oil_consumption = rnorm(sample_size, mean=2, sd=0.5),
  family_history = factor(sample(rbind('yes', 'no'), sample_size, replace=TRUE)),
  stage = factor(sample(1:4, sample_size, replace=TRUE), ordered=TRUE),
  mortality = rbinom(sample_size, 1, prob=0.02)
)

# Combine patient and control data
data <- rbind(patients, controls)

# To perform logistic regression (find associations in a model)

model <- glm(mortality ~ age + sex + vitamin_D + red_meat_consumption + fish_consumption + olive_oil_consumption + family_history + stage, data=data, family=binomial)
summary(model)

# Perform t-test (age numerical variable ~ bladder cancer catigorical variable, binary variable)
t.test(data$age ~ data$group)

# Perform ANOVA (anova for age and "bladder cancer stage", stages are 1, 2, 3 and 4)

anova_result <- aov(vitamin_D ~ group, data=data)
summary(anova_result)

# Perform chi-square test (two cat variables)
chisq_result <- chisq.test(table(data$sex, data$group))
chisq_result

# now we can make any graph using the beloww pack:
library(ggplot2)

# Example: scatter plot of stage and age
ggplot(data, aes(x=stage, y=age)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=group)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title="Scatter Plot of Stage and Age", x="Stage of Cancer", y="Age")

# to customize the graphs for example for a linear model (data are not included here):
legend(65, 15, legend = c("model1: linear", "model: poly x^2", "model3: poly x^2 + x^3"), 
       col=c("red", "blue", "green", "gray", "orange"), lty=c(1,1,3,4,5), lwd=5, bty="n", cex=0.9)
